In this repository, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a past assignment (see my GitHub repository: python-api-challenge). 

**Navigating Through The Repository**

The structure of the repository is simple: 

- In the main repo page, you can find the html files for each web page, as well as the css file for the styling.
- In *data processing* you can find the jupyter notebook and files for the conversion from csv to html.
- In *resources* you can find the images used on the web page.
- In *screenshots* you can find screenshots regarding the web page, and different screen sizes.

**Webpage: Contents**

1. A landing page

This page contains an explanation of the project, as well as links to each visualizations page. There also is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.

2. Four visualization pages

Each of these pages includes a descriptive title and heading tag, preceding the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison. With each image, there is a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3. A comparison page

It contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can be all seen easily, and thus, compared.


4. A data page

This page displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

**Webpage: Properties**

Size is responsive to the size of the screen: navigation bar, grids and tables all adjust to different screen sizes. Bootstrap was used for styling, as well as specifically for the navbar, thumbnail and responsive table.
